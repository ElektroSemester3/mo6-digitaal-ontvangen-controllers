2. REPORT DETAILS
-----------------
CKLD-2#1 Warning
Clock Net has IO Driver, not a Clock Buf, and/or non-Clock loads  
Clock net enable_0_IBUF is directly driven by an IO rather than a Clock Buffer or may be an IO driving a mix of Clock Buffer and non-Clock loads. This connectivity should be reviewed and corrected as appropriate. Driver(s): design_1_i/enable_0, enable_0_IBUF_inst/O
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#1 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[0] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[0]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#2 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[1] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[1]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#3 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[2] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[2]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#4 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[3] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[3]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#5 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[4] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[4]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#6 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[5] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[5]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#7 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[6] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[6]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#8 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[7] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[7]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

TIMING-20#9 Warning
Non-clocked latch  
The latch design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[8] cannot be properly analyzed as its control pin design_1_i/frequency_to_number_0/U0/value_reg[8]/G is not reached by a timing clock
Related violations: <none>

LATCH-1#1 Advisory
Existing latches in the design  
There are 9 latches found in the design. Inferred latches are often the result of HDL coding mistakes, such as incomplete if or case statements.
Related violations: <none>
